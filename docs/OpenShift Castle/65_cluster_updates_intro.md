## Objective

Learn how to manage OpenShift cluster updates using Over-the-Air (OTA) updates to access new features, bug fixes, and security patches through a unified interface.

## Prerequisites

- Access to an OpenShift cluster or a terminal emulator connected to one.
- Understanding of OpenShift cluster versions and update channels.
- Basic knowledge of YAML syntax for patching resources using the `oc` client.

## Introduction

In the kingdom of OpenShift, keeping your cluster up-to-date ensures that your operations run smoothly and securely, much like ensuring the castle's defenses are regularly maintained and upgraded. Over-the-Air (OTA) updates provide a streamlined way to manage these updates, allowing you to leverage the latest features and improvements.

## Cluster Updates Overview

OpenShift clusters support OTA updates, enabling administrators to apply new features, bug fixes, and security patches as they become available. This capability ensures that your cluster remains robust and up-to-date, much like a castle that regularly upgrades its fortifications and amenities.

## Changing the Update Channel

In OpenShift, an update channel represents a specific upgrade path, guiding the cluster through different versions and ensuring compatibility and stability. Switching to a different update channel can be likened to choosing a new strategy for enhancing the castle's defenses, ensuring that you stay ahead of potential threats.

### Steps to Change the Update Channel:

1. **Identify the Desired Channel**: Determine the channel you want to switch to based on your requirements (e.g., stability, new features).
2. **Use the `oc` Client to Patch the Cluster Version**: Apply the patch to change the update channel.

### Example:

To switch to the "fast-4.14" update channel using the `oc` client:

```bash
oc patch clusterversion version --type="merge" --patch '{"spec":{"channel":"fast-4.14"}}'
```

This command changes the update channel to "fast-4.14," allowing the cluster to receive updates from this channel. It's akin to directing the castle's guards to adopt a new protocol for enhanced security.

## Conclusion

Managing cluster updates effectively is crucial for maintaining a secure and efficient OpenShift environment. By utilizing OTA updates and appropriately managing update channels, you ensure that your cluster, much like a well-defended castle, remains fortified against potential issues while benefiting from the latest advancements and features.
